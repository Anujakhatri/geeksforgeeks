#Police and Thieves
#Given an array arr[], where each element contains either a 'P' for policeman or a 'T' for thief. Find the maximum number of thieves that can be caught by the police. 

#Keep in mind the following conditions :
# -Each policeman can catch only one thief.
# -A policeman cannot catch a thief who is more than k units away from him.
