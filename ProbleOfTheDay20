#Group Balls by Sequence
#You are given an array arr[] of positive integers, where each element arr[i] represents the number written on the i-th ball, and a positive integer k.
#Your task is to determine whether it is possible to rearrange all the balls into groups such that:

#Each group contains exactly k balls.
#The numbers in each group are consecutive integers

from collections import Counter

class Solution:
    def validgroup(self, arr ,k):
        # Code here
        if len(arr)%k!=0:
            return False
        
        count=Counter(arr)
        for num in sorted(count):
            freq = count[num]
            if freq > 0:
                for i in range(1, k):
                    if count[num + i] < freq:
                        return False
                    count[num + i] -= freq
        return True
